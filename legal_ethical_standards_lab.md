# Legal & Ethical Standards Task üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ‚öñÔ∏è ‚úÖ ‚ùå

**Scenario 1**
- *Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?*
Yes - if the banking organisation were to accept, they would be breaking GDPR laws. They have also broken GDPR by allowing the payday loan company to access authentic customer data to test their algorithm, as they hadn't informed the implicated customers prior to doing so, which again is breaching GDPR - they should've used dummy data instead. 
- *What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?*
The obvious ethical concern here would be that the banking organisation would be putting their most vulnerable customers at increased financial risk, by selling their data to a company that would benefit from a customer's debt/financial struggle. This would be highly unethical, as banks should be working to promote their customer's best financial interests, not exacerbate their debt.
In addition, socially debt is a taboo subject, and such information should be kept confidential between a customer and their bank, not given to a third party for financial gain, as this could lead to leaks, shame and embarrassment on behalf of the customer if friends or family were to see a targeted communication from a payday loan company. 
- *What could the company do to address the issue?*
The banking organisation should decline the offer of partnership from the payday loan company, so as not to share any of their customer's financial information and thereby protect their customers. 




**Scenario 2**
*Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?*
No - GDPR isn't being breached in this scenario, as there is no mention of sharing personal data collected from playing the game, with third parties.
*What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?*
The ethical concern in this scenario is the addictive design element that the game company are cultivating in the development of the game, by rewarding continued use/play with new content, rather than releasing it at regular intervals as previously was done. This means players may feel pressure to invest time into the game to access the same levels as friends, rather than just dipping in and out of the game, cultivating addition. In addition, they are adding in a monetised method of completeing the game more quickly by paying for hints, which encourages the most dedicated player to spend tangible money on an intangible item. There isn't an inherent or legal concern with this, as people have the freedom to spend their money as they see appropriate, however combined with the purposely engineered addictive nature of the game, there are ethical concerns when considering those players with more addictive personalities and traits, who may be at risk of going into debt. 
*What could the company do to address the issue?*
Rather than selling hints, take sponsers who could pay for advertisement - e.g. a player could watch a short advert video for a hint rather than paying directly, thereby the developer would still generate revenue without directly taking the user's money. 
Not offering multi-buy discounts may encourage people to spend less money in the app - multi-buy encourages bulk buying which may lead to debt more quickly. 



**Scenario 3**
*Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?*
Potentially - GDPR could be being breached by sharing the user's location with businesses advertising their wares, if the user hasn't explicitly been made aware that this is the case. 
*What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?*
The ethical concern here again relates to vulnerability of the user. The target user is someone who is new to an area looking to make friends, therefore by limiting the number of potential daily matches in the free vesion and creating a premium, paid service, the company could be seen to be extorting money off lonely people who feel they need to pay for the application in order to find friends and cure their loneliness. 
*What could the company do to address the issue?*
Made free users explicitly aware of how their location data is being used when first signing up to the application. 
Make the number of potential daily matches unlimited in the free version, but still have some paid features as a premium subscription, so long as they won't prolong someone's isolation or loneliness.
